Pipex is a project designed as part of the 1337 School cursus, aiming to develop a program that simulates the behavior of shell commands involving pipes. The project is divided into two main parts: a mandatory section and a bonus section, challenging students to implement fundamental Unix functionalities.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of Pipex is to create a program that mimics the behavior of the following shell command:
```shell
$> < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
```
